### Issue [#49](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-typing/issues/49) manual test

Non-breakable spaces created by browser after using <kbd>space</kbd> should be changed to normal space characters when
inserted to model and view. Still, `&nbsp;` have to be correctly rendered in DOM.

Multiple consecutive spaces should be allowed, as well as spaces at the beginning or end of element.

Open console and start using <kbd>space</kbd>. After each change, console is refreshed with output:
* There should be no `&nbsp;` inserted in view and model after using <kbd>space</kbd>.
* There should be `&nbsp;` in DOM and `getData` output, where needed.

Use `editor.setData()` to test whether whitespaces in input HTML are correctly removed and `&nbsp;` are correctly
saved in model and view. `&nbsp;` inserted through `editor.setData()` should be kept, not changed to normal spaces.

Test at least this scenario:
* fire `editor.setData( '<p>&nbsp;x</p>' )`,
* place caret at the beginning, before space,
* write `x` -> `&nbsp;` should be preserved in model, view and DOM,
* place caret at the beginning,
* press <kbd>space</kbd> -> `&nbsp;` should appear in DOM, but space in model and view,
* place caret at the beginning,
* write `x` -> `&nbsp;` should get converted to a space in DOM.
