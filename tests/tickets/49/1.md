### Issue [#49](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-typing/issues/49) manual test

There should be no `&nbsp;` (`\u00A0`) characters in model and view, but they should be rendered in DOM. Multiple
consecutive spaces should be allowed, as well as spaces at the beginning or end of element.

Open console and start using <kbd>space</kbd>. After each change, console is refreshed with output:
* All `&nbsp;` from model and view are being changed to `_`.
* There should be no `_` in view and model output.
* There should be `&nbsp;` in DOM and `getData` output, where needed.

Use `editor.setData()` to test whether whitespaces in input HTML are correctly removed.
